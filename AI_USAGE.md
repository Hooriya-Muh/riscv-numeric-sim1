# AI Usage Summary

This document summarizes limited and allowed AI assistance used during the
development of this project.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

## How AI Was Used
AI assistance was used **only for the following non-prohibited tasks**:

### 1. Debugging help
Occasional guidance was used when resolving test failures (e.g., identifying a
normalization bug in float addition and correcting bit-alignment logic).  
All final code was manually written, edited, and understood by the student.

### 2. Clarifying algorithm behavior
AI was used to *explain* IEEE-754 rounding rules, two’s-complement overflow
conditions, and RISC-V M-extension edge cases, similar to using a tutor or TA.

### 3. Writing assistance (documentation only)
AI helped polish wording in:
- README.md  
- small comments  
- AI_USAGE.md (this file)  
No implementation code was generated by AI for these parts.

### 4. CLI formatting help
AI provided minor suggestions on how to cleanly print hex/bin output for the
demo CLI tool. The implementation itself was written manually.

## What AI Was **Not** Used For
- No core implementation code (adder, shifter, MDU, FPU) was generated by AI.  
- No algorithmic logic, bit-level operations, or arithmetic design came from AI.  
- No test code was generated by AI.  
- No restricted/forbidden operations were substituted using AI tools.

## Compliance
This usage complies with the project requirements since:
- All numeric logic is authored manually.
- AI assistance was limited to explanations, debugging help, and documentation.
- All final code was fully reviewed, rewritten, and verified by the student.
